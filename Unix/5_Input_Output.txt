Standard input
  stdin

Standard outputs : is defined as the monitor
  stdout

When directing input and output, the input is always placed first

To output to a new file : use ">"
  sort -n numbers.txt > new_numbers.txt

Add a new line to a text file
  echo "My New Line" >> existing_file.txt

Directing input from a file
  1. echo "(3*4)+5/2" > calculation.txt
  2. bc < calculation.txt : takes content of calculation.txt as input and returns calculation result

Combination of IO
  sort < fruit.txt > sorted_fruit.txt : reads from left to right first

Use pipes to direct output without using an intermediate file
  echo "Hello World" | wc
  echo "(3*2)+(11/12)" | bc
  cat fruit.txt | less

Suppressing Output (no output at all)
  ls -la > /dev/null :will not output to anything
  echo < /dev/null : will not input anything
