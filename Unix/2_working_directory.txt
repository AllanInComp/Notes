Difference between cd Users/allan and /User/allan
  -/Users/allan is the absolute path starting from the parent disk

FileSystem organization
  /: Root
  /bin: Binaries, programs
  /sbin: System binaries, system programs
  /dev: devices
  /etc: system config
  /home: user home directories
  /lib: libraries of code
  /tmp: temporary files
  /var: various
  /usr: user programs, tools and libraries (not files)

Mac-only FileSystem
/Applications: Mac Programs
/Library: Mac libraries of code
/Network: Networked devices
/System: Mac OS X
/Users: User home directories
/Volumes: Mounted Volumes
.DS_Store: Holds folder view options, icon positions

File naming:
  -max 255 characters
  -Avoid certain symbols: >?/\|$?%&^~
  -hyphen not as first character
  -typically lowercase (UNIX is case sensitive)
  -underscores better than spaces (easier for unix to recognize)

To access file with space (ex: Application Support)
  -cd Application\ Support
  -cd "Application Support"

Creating files
  touch somefile.txt
    -if somefile.txt doesn't exist, command will create one

Unix Text editors
  nano somefile.txt

Reading files
  cat somefile.txt
    -concatenante 1 or more text file inputs to display on command
  more somefile.txt
    -some thing but has pagenation
  less somefile.txt
    -backward scrolling, better memory use, overall replaces more command
    less commands:
      g : go to the top
      q : quit view
      less -M : tells % of the page
      less -N : shows line numbers

Reading Portions Of Files:
  head: Displays lines from beginning
  tail: Displays lines from end
  tail -f : "Follow" the tail of a file, shows any updates to the file

Making a directory
  mkdir somefolder
  mkdir -p somefolder/nested1/nested2/nested3 : need to add -p for multiple folder creation for nested Structure

Moving and removing files
  mv newfile.txt newfolder

Rename files
  mv newfile.txt newfile2.txt : will rename the txt wile moving it
  -n : no overwriting
  -f : force overwriting (turned on by default)
  -i : interactive overwriting (ask me)
  -v : verbose

Copy files and directories
  cp original_file.txt somefolder/pastedfile.txt
  -f : force overwriting

Deleting files and directories
  rm somefile.txt
  rmdir somefolder
  -R : remove everything inside the folder recursively
  -deleting files in unix will not make the file go to trash

Finder aliases in Unix
  -aliases needs storage space to contain information to its linked file
  -mac aliases are useless to UNIX, will give nonsense characters
  -points to the same storage spage (not the path)
  Unix uses Hard Links :
  ln filetolink hardlink
    -reference a file in the system
    -do not break if file is moved or deleted
    -required size is exactly the same as the orignal file (points to the same spot)

Symbolic Links
  ln -s filetolink symlink
  -references a file path or a directory path
  -will show symlink -> filetolink in ls -lah command
  -only uses memory to store file path
  -will break if original file is renamed, moved or removed

Searching for files and directories
  find path expression
  ex: find ~/Documents -name "someimage.jpg"
  Wildcard characters
  *: 0 or more characters (glob)
  ?: any one character
  []: any character in the brackets
  ex: find ~/Documents -name "s?me*[s,a,r]" : a file/folder named "somefolder" can be matched up
