Interaction Design Concepts

chapters 7 (needs->requirements) & 13(design framework: agile UEX) are not included in course, are reading material (included in exam/quiz)

quiz covers material after previous quizzes to the date of the second quiz
==================================================================================================


Chapter 1:

Definition (Interaction design): 
	-The design of spaces for human communication and interaction
	Designing interactive products to support how people communicate and interact with stuff
	Goal: develop useful products providing intuitive & enjoyable user experience
	Means: through interface interaction (how users act and react to events and inter-communicate)
	Contributors to ID: psychology, social science, computing science, engineering
	Design practices contributing to ID: graphic,product,artist-design,industrial,film

Good design: easy to learn, effective to use, enjoyable, error tolerant (mistake recovery).


Knowledge required before UI design:
	-User profile, behavior, background, skill level
	-task to accomplish
	-context and environment where the system will be used
	-technicality
	
HCI: human-computer interaction
	-bi directional relation to interaction design
	-main difference: scope. 
		ID: has a much wider scope (theory, research, practice of designing user experiences for all manner of technologies, systems, and products)
			
		HCI: concerns only with design, evaluation and implementation of interactive computing systems for human use



Multidisciplinary teams:
	Adv: different perspectives, more ideas & methods to develop
		Conceptualizing the design space early on;
			orientation: enable design team to ask specific kinds of questions about how the conceptual model will be understood be the targeted users
			open-mindedness: prevent design team to have narrow focus
			common ground: set of common terms (reduce chance of misunderstandings)
	DisAdv: difficult to communicate progress, COI (computer engineer vs graphical designer)

Chapter 2:

Conceptual model (abstraction outlining functionality of a product & its interaction with people):	
	Components:
		Metaphors and analogies: convey understanding of the product and its use
		Concepts exposed: domain objects, attributes, operations 
		Relationships between concepts (whether one object contains another)
		Mappings between the concepts and the user experience the product is designed to support/invoke
	Best models:
		-appear obvious
		-intuitive operations
		-constrained way of performing a specific operation
