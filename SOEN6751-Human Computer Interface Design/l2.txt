Objectives:
	-Explain what is mean by the problem space
		A: understanding and conceptualizing what is currently the user experience/product and how this is going to be improved or changed
	-Explain how to conceptualize interaction
		
	-Describe what a conceptual model is and how to begin to formulate one
		Orientation: enable design team to ask specific kinds of questions about how the conceptual model will be understood by users
		Open-mindedness: prevent design team from being narrowly focused
		Common ground: allow design team to establish set of common terms
	-Discuss the use of interface metaphors as part of a conceptual model
		Convey to people how to understand what a product is for and how to use it 
		Provide a structure that is similar to a familiar entity to the customer.
	-Outline the core interaction types for informing the development of a conceptual model
		Instructing: user issues instructions to system (ex: typing in commands, selecting options)
		Conversing: users have dialog to system (ex: customer speak/type questions => text/speech output from system)
		Manipulating: users interact with objects in virtual/physical space by manipulating them (ex: open, holding, closing, placing objects on desktop)
		Exploring: users move through virtual environment/physical space (ex: 3D worlds)
	-Introduce paradigms, visions, theories, models and frameworks informing interaction design
		Paradigms: adopt a set of practices that a community has agreed upon 
			-questions to be asked and how they should be framed
			-phenomena to be observed
			-way in which findings from studies are to be analyzed and interpreted
		Visions: visions of the future (expectations, concrete scenarios of how society can use future imagined technologies)
		Theories: analyze and predict performance of users carrying out tasks for specific kinds of computer interfaces/systems
		Models: abstracted from a theory, can be directly applied to interaction design
		Frameworks: help constrain and scope the UX for which they are designing
		
Conceptual model (abstraction outlining functionality of a product & its interaction with people):	
	Components:
		Metaphors and analogies: convey understanding of the product and its use
		Concepts exposed: domain objects, attributes, operations 
		Relationships between concepts (whether one object contains another)
		Mappings between the concepts and the user experience the product is designed to support/invoke
	Best models:
		-appear obvious
		-intuitive operations
		-constrained way of performing a specific operation

Slides:

What is involved in process of interaction design
	-identify needs and establish requirements for UX 
	-develop alternative designs to meet requirements 
	-build interactive prototype: do design and prototype together
	-process of prioritizing user concerns
		-key: choose between alternatives
	-4 approaches:
		user-centered design: everything done from the user's perspective
		activity-centered design: behavior surrounding specific tasks (user behaviors also)
		systems design: good for complex problems, structured design
		genius design: creative flair of the designer
		
The double diamond of design
	-problem -> design brief -> solution
	
Understanding the problem space
	explore: current UX, why is a change needed, how will this change improve the situation
	articulate problem space: team effort, explore different perspectives, avoid incorrect assumptions
	
Degres of user involvement
	-Member of the design team: full(constant output, lose touch with users)/part time(stressful), short/long term



User-centered approach: 
	constant user feedback until user has no further feedback => stable
	iterative design: find problems in user testing -> fix -> more testing
	1. Early focus on users and tasks
	2. Empirical measurement: help choose different alternate designs by measuring quantifiable usability
	3. Iterative design: refine based on feedback
	
Google design sprints (iterations in linear fashion, short periods):
	1. unpack
	2. sketch
	3. decide
	4. prototype
	5. test
	
Star lifecycle model:
	designed more from practice rather than theory
	
Users/Stakeholders
	Users:
		primary: frequent hands-on
		secondary: occasional
		tertiary: affected by its introduction / will influence its purchase
	Stakeholders: people affected directly/indirectly by the design
