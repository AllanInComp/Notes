Design, Prototyping and Construction （Chapter 11 in ebook e4)\

Objective:

Describe prototyping and different types of prototyping activities.
	-

Enable you to produce simple prototypes from the models developed
during the requirements activity.

Enable you to produce a conceptual model for a product and justify
your choices.

Explain the use of scenarios and prototypes in design.

Introduce physical computing kits and software development kits, and
their role in construction.


Lecture:

Conceptual design: from requirements to design
	requirements/needs => conceptual model
	understandable by users in manner intended
	iterative
	prototypes allow alternatives
	characteristics of the concept model:
		-what functions will the product perform?
		-how are functions related to each other? (sequential/parallel, categorizations)
		-what information needs to be available? (required data to perform task, how data is transformed by system)

Concrete design:
	vs Conceptual design: more emphasis on many aspects (color, icons, buttons, interaction devices, ...)
	user characteristics and context (ex: inclusiveness, input, and output modes)
	accessibility (ex: web content accessibility guidelines)
	cross-cultural design (languages, colors, icons, indigenous knowledge)

Mental models (knowledge of system):
	Understand system by learning/using it
	used as inference when carrying out tasks
	evoked through metaphors (picture, word, message)

Metaphore evaluation:
	how much structure it provides
	relevance to problem
	easy to represent
	understandable by audience
	extensibility

Prototype
	Definition: manifestation of a design that allows stakeholders to interact with it
		-small scale model
	Purpose:
		Evaluate and feedback in interaction design
		Stakeholders can see,hold,interact with a prototype better than document/drawing
		Communication between team members, idea testing, reflection
	Low fidelity prototyping:
		uses a medium which is unlike the final medium
		Adv: quick, cheap and easily changed
		Dis: limited error checking, poor detailed specs, limited usability
		ex: sketches of screens, post-it notes, storyboards
		Storyboards: brings more detial and chance of role play
			-series of sketches showing how a user might progress through a task using the device
			-early design
		Sketching: important in low fidelity prototyping
		Wizard of Oz prototyping: interact with user, gain insight by developer pretending to be system output
			disadvantages: simulations require training so wizard can respond in a credible way, inconsistent responses, need to control behavior to be predictable, improvisation of wizard to go beyond expected behavior
	High fidelity prototyping:
		materials expected in final product
		danger that users think they have a full system
		Adv： complete functionality, fully interactive, user-driven, marketing and sales tool
		Dis: resource-intensive, time-consuming, inefficient proof-of-concept designs, ineffective requirements gathering
	Scenarios in design:
		express proposed or imagined situations
		scripts, concrete examples of tasks
		plus and minus scenarios to explore extreme cases
	Compromises (compared to final product):
		Horizontal: wide range of functions but little detail
		Vertical: focused detail on few functions
	Explore the User's experience:
		use personas, card-based prototypes or stickies to model the UX
		Visual representation: design map, customer/user journey map, experience map
		Representations: wheel or timeline
