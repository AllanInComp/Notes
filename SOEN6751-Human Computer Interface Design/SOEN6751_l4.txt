Design, Prototyping and Construction （Chapter 11 in ebook e4)\

Objective:

Describe prototyping and different types of prototyping activities.
	-For users to evaluate the design of an interactive product effectively, designers must prototype their ideas. 
	-Prototype definition: manifestation of a design that allows stakeholders to interact with it and to explore its suitability 
	-Low fidelity prototyping: 
		low in : meterial quality, set of functions (or only represent/can't perform)
		adv: simple, cheap, quick to produce 
		ex: 
			storyboarding (series of sketches on user interaction)
			sketching (simple boxes & stick figures of actions, no narrative)
			index cards (small pieces of cardboard, each card represents a screen or one element of the interaction)
			Wizard of Oz (assume software-based prototype, user interacts with software mimicing product interaction, human operator simulates software's response to user
	-High fidelity prototyping:
		adv: useful in selling ideas (demos) and testing out technical issues
	
Enable you to produce simple prototypes from the models developed
during the requirements activity.

Enable you to produce a conceptual model for a product and justify
your choices.

Explain the use of scenarios and prototypes in design.

Introduce physical computing kits and software development kits, and
their role in construction.

Lecture:

Conceptual design: from requirements to design
	requirements/needs => conceptual model 
	Conceptual Model:
		Outline of what people can do with a product and what concepts are needed to understand how to interact with it 
	understandable by users in manner intended 
	iterative 
	prototypes allow alternatives 
	characteristics of the concept model:
		-what functions will the product perform?
		-how are functions related to each other? (sequential/parallel, categorizations)
		-what information needs to be available? (required data to perform task, how data is transformed by system)

Concrete design:
	vs Conceptual design: more emphasis on many aspects (color, icons, buttons, interaction devices, ...)
	user characteristics and context (ex: inclusiveness, input, and output modes) 
	accessibility (ex: web content accessibility guidelines)
	cross-cultural design (languages, colors, icons, indigenous knowledge)
	
Mental models (knowledge of system): 
	Understand system by learning/using it 
	used as inference when carrying out tasks
	evoked through metaphors (picture, word, message)

Metaphore evaluation:
	1.how much structure it provides 
	2.relevance to problem
	3.easy to represent
	4.understandable by audience 
	5.extensibility (useful later on)
	
	
Using Scenarios:

Scenario 3: Hyper-wonderland
	This scenario addresses the positive aspects of how a hypermedia solution
	will work.
	The setting is the Lindholm construction site sometime in the future.
	Kurt has access to a portable PC. The portables are hooked up to the
	computer at the site office via a wireless modem connection, through which
	the supervisors run the hypermedia application.
	Action: During inspection of one of the caissons1 Kurt takes his portable PC,
	switches it on and places the cursor on the required information. He clicks
	the mouse button and gets the master file index together with an overview of
	links. He chooses the links of relevance for the caisson he is inspecting.
	Kurt is pleased that he no longer needs to plan his inspections in advance.
	This is a great help because due to the ‘event-driven’ nature of inspection,
	constructors never know where and when an inspection is taking place.
	Moreover, it has become much easier to keep track of personal notes,
	reports etc. because they can be entered directly on the spot.
	The access via the construction site interface does not force him to deal with
	complicated keywords either. Instead, he can access the relevant
	information right away, literally from where he is standing.
	A positive side-effect concerns his reachability. As long as he has logged in
	on the computer, he is within reach of the secretaries and can be contacted
	when guests arrive or when he is needed somewhere else on the site.
	Moreover, he can see at a glance where his colleagues are working and get
	in touch with them when he needs their help or advice.
	All in all, Kurt feels that the new computer application has put him more in
	control of things.

Scenario 4: Panopticon
	This scenario addresses the negative aspects of how a hypermedia solution
	will work.
	The setting is the Lindholm construction site sometime in the future.
	Kurt has access to a portable PC. The portables are hooked up to the
	computer at the site office via a wireless modem connection, through which
	the supervisors run the hypermedia application.
	Action: During inspecting one of the caissons Kurt starts talking to one of the
	builders about some reinforcement problem. They argue about the recent lab
	tests, and he takes out his portable PC in order to provide some data which
	justify his arguments. It takes quite a while before he finds a spot where he
	can place the PC: either there is too much light, or there is no level surface
	at a suitable height. Finally, he puts the laptop on a big box and switches it
	on. He positions the cursor on the caisson he is currently inspecting and
	clicks the mouse to get into the master file. The table of contents pops up
	and from the overview of links he chooses those of relevance – but no lab
	test appears on the screen. Obviously, the file has not been updated as
	planned.

Prototype
	Definition: manifestation of a design that allows stakeholders to interact with it 
		-small scale model 
	Purpose:
		Evaluate and feedback in interaction design
		Stakeholders can see,hold,interact with a prototype better than document/drawing 
		Communication between team members, idea testing, reflection 
	Low fidelity prototyping:
		uses a medium which is unlike the final medium 
		Adv: quick, cheap and easily changed 
		Dis: limited error checking, poor detailed specs, limited usability
		ex: sketches of screens, post-it notes, storyboards
		Storyboards: brings more detial and chance of role play
			-series of sketches showing how a user might progress through a task using the device 
			-early design 
		Sketching: important in low fidelity prototyping
		Wizard of Oz prototyping: interact with user, gain insight by developer pretending to be system output
			disadvantages: simulations require training so wizard can respond in a credible way, inconsistent responses, need to control behavior to be predictable, improvisation of wizard to go beyond expected behavior 
	High fidelity prototyping:
		materials expected in final product 
		danger that users think they have a full system
		Adv： complete functionality, fully interactive, user-driven, marketing and sales tool
		Dis: resource-intensive, time-consuming, inefficient proof-of-concept designs, ineffective requirements gathering 
	Scenarios in design:
		express proposed or imagined situations 
		scripts, concrete examples of tasks
		plus and minus scenarios to explore extreme cases 
	Compromises (compared to final product): 
		Horizontal: wide range of functions but little detail 
		Vertical: focused detail on few functions 
	Explore the User's experience:	
		use personas, card-based prototypes or stickies to model the UX 
		Visual representation: design map, customer/user journey map, experience map 
		Representations: wheel or timeline 

Low-fidelity prototype
	Adv:
		Lower development cost
		Evaluates multiple design concepts
		Useful communication device
		Addresses screen layout issues
		Useful for identifying market requirements
		Proof of concept
	Disadv:
		Limited error checking 
		Poor detailed specification to code to
		Facilitator-driven
		Limited utility after requirements established
		Limited usefulness for usability tests
		Navigational and flow limitations
		
High-fidelity prototype
	Adv:
		Complete functionality
		Fully interactive
		User-driven
		Clearly defines navigational scheme
		Use for exploration and	test
		Look and feel of final product
		Serves as a living specification
		Marketing and sales tool
	Disadv:
		More resource-intensive to develop
		Time-consuming to create
		Inefficient for proof-of-concept designs
		Not effective for requirements gathering
