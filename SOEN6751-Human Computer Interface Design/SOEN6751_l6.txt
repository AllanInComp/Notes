Objectives
Explain how to do usability testing.
Outline the basics of experimental design.
Describe how to do field studies.

==============================================================================
Lecture:

Overview:
  recording performance of typical users doing typical tasks
  controlled environment
  users observed and timed
  data is recorded on video and key presses are logged
  data is used to calculate performance times
  user satisfaction is evaluated using questionnaires and Interviews
  field observation for contextual understanding

Testing iPad usability:
  7 participants with 3+ months experience with iPhones
  signed consents to explain experience and follow regulations
  explore => perform randomly assigned specified tasks
  Problems detected:
    -accessing the web was Difficulties
    -lack of affordance and Feedback
    -knowing where to tap
  Actions by evaluators:
    -reported to developers
  Testing conditions:
    usability lab or other controlled space
    emphasis on selecting representative users, developing representative tasks
  Some type of data:
    time to complete task (+after specified time away from product)
    number and type of errors per task/unit of time
    number of users making particular error/completing task successfully

Testing conditions:

Summary (continued)
 The experimenter controls independent variable(s) in
order to measure dependent variable(s)
 Field studies are evaluation studies that are carried out in
natural settings to discover how people interact with
technology in the real world
 Field studies that involve the deployment of prototypes or
technologies in natural settings may also be referred to as
‘in-the-wild’ studies
 Sometimes the findings of a field study are unexpected,
especially for in-the-wild studies that explore how novel
technologies are used by participants in their own homes,
places of work, or outside
