Evaluation Chapter 13

The specific aims of this chapter are to:

Explain the key concepts and terms used in evaluation. Introduce a range of different types of evaluation methods.



Show how different evaluation methods are used for different purposes at different stages of the design process and in different contexts of use.
Show how evaluators mix and modify methods to meet the demands of evaluating novel systems.
Discuss some of the practical challenges that evaluators have to consider when doing evaluation.

Lectures:

UI evaluation is:
  Test design ideas with representative end-users in as natural an environment as possible
  Discover how good/bad the design is and as many ways as possible
  A de-risking activity and a diagnostic tool

UI evaluation is not:
  Design review with team members or stakeholders
  QA of the software
  Rubber stamp of approval, applied on a product before it goes out the door

Why: check that users can use the product and that they like it
What: conceptual model, early prototypes of a new system and later, more complete prototypes
Where: natural and lab settings
When: throughout design, even finished products

Things to consider when interpreting disadvantages
  Reliability: method produce same results
  Validity: method measures correct subjects
  Ecological Validity: environment doesn't distort results
  Biases: Human bias
  Scope: how generalizable are the results

Evaluation approaches
  Usability testing: controlled env tasks on prototype stage, quantitative results measured
  Field studies: natural env behavior by users on early stage, qualitative results described
  Analytical Evaluation: no users involved, prototype, problems presented by experts
  Combining approaches
