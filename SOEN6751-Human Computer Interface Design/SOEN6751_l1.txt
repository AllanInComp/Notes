==========

Chapter 1:

Objectives:
	-explain difference between good and poor interaction design
		ans: easy to learn, effective to use, provide enjoyable experience
		Five E's of Good Interface design: easy to learn, engaging, effective to use, enjoyable, error tolerant (mistake recovery).
	-describe what interaction design is and how it relates to human-computer interaction and other fields
		ans: designing interactive products to support the way people communicate an interact in their everyday and working lives.
		relation with HCI: difference of scope, ID has wider net (theory, research, practice), HCI: (design, evaluation and implementation)	
	-explain the relationship between the user experience and usability
		user experience(UX): how a product behaves and is used by people in the real world, is psychological, not deterministic
		usability: the ease of use and learnability of a human-made object such as a tool or device (important quality indicator)
			-uses 5 e's to quantify a product 
		relation: good usability elevates UX quality
	-describe what and who is involved in the process of interaction design
		1. Establish requirements 2. Design alternatives 3. Prototyping 4. Evaluating
	-outline the different forms of guidances used in ID
		-visibility: more visible functions -> easier for users to recognize and know what to do next
		-feedback: sends back info to the user after interaction(s)
		-constraints: restricting kinds of user interaction that can take place at a given moment
		-consistency: designing interfaces to have similar operations and use similar elements for achieving similar tasks
		-affordance: attribute of an object that allows people to know how to use it (mouse button = pushing)
	-evaluate an interactive product and explain what is good and bad about it in terms of the goals and core principles of ID

Definition (Interaction design): 
	-The design of spaces for human communication and interaction
	Designing interactive products to support how people communicate and interact with stuff
	Goal: develop useful products providing intuitive & enjoyable user experience
	Means: through interface interaction (how users act and react to events and inter-communicate)
	Components of ID:
		Contributors to ID: psychology, social science, computing science, engineering
		Design practices contributing to ID: graphic,product,artist-design,industrial,film
	User Interface Design:	
		Difference to software dev: ensure that the system will be effectively usable
			-focuses on ease of use/learning, efficiency of task completion instead of designing robust/reliable software
			Knowledge required before User Interface Design:
				-User profile, behavior, background, skill level
				-task to accomplish
				-context and environment where the system will be used
				-technicality
		Difficulties of UID: study on diversity/capability/preference of users, COI with software devs 
	
		

HCI: human-computer interaction
	-bi directional relation to interaction design
	-main difference: scope. 
		ID: has a much wider scope (theory, research, practice of designing user experiences for all manner of technologies, systems, and products)
			
		HCI: concerns only with design, evaluation and implementation of interactive computing systems for human use

User Experience (UX):
	-central to interaction design
	Core threads that make up holistic experience
		-sensual: level of absorption people have with devices/applications (thrill, fear, pain, comfort)
		-emotional: smooth functioning of an app increases happiness
		-compositional: narrative part of an experience, how user understands composition & function of an app
		-spatio-temporal: space and time where user interacts with product

UX vs Usability:
	ISO Definition: Usability is concerned with the “effectiveness, 
	efficiency and satisfaction with which specified users achieve specified goals 
		in particular environments” whilst user experience is concerned with 
		“all aspects of the user’s experience when interacting with the product, service, environment or facility” 
	
	Four elements of the Usability
		Functionality: Can this product work normally?
		Learnability: Can this product be used without extra learning?
		Flexibility: Can this product do something more except accomplishing the main task?
		Industry design: Is this product pretty enough?
		Plus, keep these 5 crucial usability principles in mind all the time.

	Four elements of the User Experience
		Usability: Is it easy to complete tasks?
		Adaptability: Will people start using the product?
		Desirability: Is the experience fun and engaging?
		Value: Does a product provide value to users?
	
Accessibility vs Inclusive Design:
	Accessibility is about creating products that are usable by everyone. 
	Inclusive design, on the other hand, is a mindset that involves understanding user diversity
	
Process of ID:
	1. Establish requirements
	2. Designing alternatives
	3. Prototyping
	4. Evaluating	

Design Principles:
	Visibility: more visible functions allow ease of use for user
	Feedback: how consequences of action from use is fed back to them to allow continuation of activity
	Constraints: restricting kinds of user interaction that can take place at a given moment
	Consistency: designing interfaces to have similar operations and use similar elements for achieving similar tasks (easier to learn and use)
	Affordance: attribute of an object that allows people to know how to use it (to give a clue)
		-ex: checkboxes tells the users they can choose multiple options
		-in ID, 'perceived' affordances are most conceptualized (mapping conventions of the interface)

Usability Principles:
	Visibility of system status
	Match between system and the real world
	User control and freedom
	Consistency and standards
	Help users recognize, diagnose and recover from errors	
	Error prevention
	Recognition rather than recall
	Flexibility and efficiency of use
	Aesthetic and minimalist design
	Help and documentation
		
Multidisciplinary teams:
	Adv: different perspectives, more ideas & methods to develop
		Conceptualizing the design space early on;
			orientation: enable design team to ask specific kinds of questions about how the conceptual model will be understood be the targeted users
			open-mindedness: prevent design team to have narrow focus
			common ground: set of common terms (reduce chance of misunderstandings)
	DisAdv: difficult to communicate progress, COI (computer engineer vs graphical designer)
	
Chapter Summary:
	ID is concerned with designing interactive products to support that way people communicate & interact
	ID is multidisciplinary, many inputs from disciplines and fields
	UE is central to ID
	Optimizing interaction between users and products requires knowledge on: context of use, type of activity, accessibility, culture, user groups
	Identifying and specifying relevant usability and user experience helps lead to design of good interactive products
