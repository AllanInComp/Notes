1. What's the difference between DELETE and TRUNCATE statements?
-DELETE command is used to delete a row in the table
  Can rollback data after a delete statement
  DML command
  slower
-TRUNCATE is used to delete all the rows in the table
  Can't rollback data
  DDL command
  faster

2. Different subsets of SQL?
  -DDL: Database Definition Language, define database schema
    ex: CREATE, ALTER, DROP, RENAME
  -DML: Database Manipulation Language, Manipulation of data present in database
    ex: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
  -DCL: Database Control Language, deals with the rights, permissions and other controls of the database system
    ex: GRANT, REVOKE
  -TCL: Transaction Control Language, manage transactions - changes made by DML statements
    ex: COMMIT, ROLLBACK, SAVEPOINT

3. What is DBMS?
  Database Management System: Software Application that interacts with the user, applications and the database itself to retrieve and analyze data

4. What is a table and a field?
-table: collection of data in an organized manner of rows and columns
-field: number of columns in the table

5. What are joins in SQL?
-JOIN clause is used to combine rows from 2+ tables based on a related column between them -> merge tables from there

6. Difference between CHAR and VARCHAR2
-CHAR : fixed length, only store data of that length
-VARCHAR2: variable length

7. Primary Key
-Set of attributes that can be used to uniquely identify every tuple in a table
-one of the candidate keys can be chosen as a primary key

8. What are Constraints ?
-limits set on the data type of the table
  Not NULL, UNIQUE, CHECK, DEFAULT (when no values specified, give default), INDEX(used to create and retrieve data from db very quickly)

9. Difference between SQL and MySQL
-SQL: Structured Query Language, core of RDBMS
-MySQL: open source RDBMS developed by Oracle, uses SQL at its core

10. Unique Key
-uniquely identifies single row in the table
-null values are allowed
-multiple values are allowed, but not duplicates

11. Foreign Key
-Maintains referential integrity by enforcing a link between the data in two tables
-foreign key in child references primary key in parent

12. Data Integrity
-Accuracy of data
-Consistency of data
-Integrity Constraints to enforce business rules on data

13. Clustered vs Non-Clustered index
-Clustered: easy retrieval of data from the db (faster), alters record storage, only one clustered index in one table
-Non-Clustered: easy retrieval of data from the db (slower), creates new record storage object, many non-clustered indexes in on table

14. SQL query to display the current date:
SELECT GETDATE();

15. Different types of JOIN
-Inner JOIN: matching values in both tables
-FULL JOIN: either have match in left or right
-LEFT JOIN: all records from left table, and matching records on the right
-RIHGT JOIN: opposite to left join

16. Denormalization
-Technique used to access data from higher to lower forms of a database
-Increase the performance of the infrastructure by introducing redundancy into a table
-Use Database queries that combine data from different tables into a single table
  -Pros: Few joins, simpler queries (look at fewer tables)
  -Cons: Updates and inserts are more expensive & harder to write (more columns), inconsistent data, more storage

17. Entities and Relationships
-Entities: object in real world whose data can be stored in a database. Stored as columns
-Relationships: Relation/link between entities.

18. Index
-Performance Tuning Method, Allows faster retrieval of records from the table, Creates and entry for each value

19. Difference types of index
-Unique Index: no duplicate values, if primary key is defined, unique index can be applied automatically
-Clustered Index: reorders physical order of the table and searches based on the basis of key values
-Non-Clustered Index: maintains a logical order of the data

20. Normalization
-Process of organizing data to avoid duplication and redundancy
-Pros: Better Organization, More tables with smaller rows, Efficient data access, flexibility for queries, easier to implement security, compact database

21. Difference between DROP and TRUNCATE
-DROP: Removes a table and can't be rolled back from the database
-TRUNCATE: Removes all rows from the table, also can't be rolled back

22. Different types of Normalization
-1NF:
  No duplicated rows
  Each cell is single-valued (no repeating groups or arrays)
  Entries in a column are of the same kind
  Rows Uniquely Identified (with unique key)
-2NF:
  1NF
  All non-key attributes are dependent on all of the key (no partial dependencies)
  ex: teacher age dependent on teacher id, must create separate table for teacher_id,teacher_age
-3NF:
  2NF
  No transitive dependencies
  ex:
-BCNF
  3NF
  every determinant is a candidate key
-4NF
  BCNF
  no multi-valued dependencies

23. What is ACID property in databases
  Atomicity: a transaction must be treated as an atomic unit (all or nothing)
  Consistency: database remains in consistent state after any transaction
  Isolation: parallelism of multiple concurrent transactions won't affect one another
  Durability: transaction will eventually persist after system failure & recovery

24. Trigger in SQL
-Stored procedures that are defined to execute automatically in place or after data modifications
  BEFORE, AFTER | INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE

26. Are NULL values same as zero or blank space?
-NULL value: represents a value which is unavailable, unknown, assigned or not applicable
-zero: number
-blank space: character

27. Difference between cross join and natural joins
-Cross: produces cross product or Cartesian product of two tables
-Natural: based on all columns having the same name and data types in both the tables

28. What us subquery in SQL
