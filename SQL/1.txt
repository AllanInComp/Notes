# SQL

Crash Course:
-Overview: Structured Query Language, work with databse, used on servers
	-databases: MySQL, dBase, PostgreSQL, Hadoop, Oracle, MS SQL, MaxDB, MariaDB, SQLite, Openbase, MongolDB
	-tools: CMD Client, Adminer, Firebird, Mysql Workbench, PHPMyAdmin, Sequel Pro(mac)
	-sensitivity: Keywords are case-insensitive (SELECT, FROM, WHERE,...), In some setups (MySQL can enable/disable), table/column names are case-sensitive

Commands
	-Create Databas
		CREATE DATABASE myDB;
		remove db: DROP DATABASE myDB;
	-Create Table
		CREATE TABLE customers (
			id INT not null auto_increment,
			firstName varchar(255) not null,
			lastname varchar(255) not null,
			email varchar(255),
			address varchar (255),
			city varchar(255),
			zipcode varchar (6),
			primary key(id) /* Can indicate as primary key after declaration */
		);
	-Insert Into Table
		INSERT INTO customers(firstName, lastname, email, address, city, zipcode) VALUES
		('John','Doe','jdoe@gmail.com','55 Main st','Boston','H2H3H3'),
		/* Any other rows */
		;
	-Update records
		UPDATE  customers
		SET email = 'test@gmail.com'
		WHERE id = 1;
	-Delete Records
		DELETE FROM customers
		WHERE id = 3;
	-Alter Table structures
		/* Add column */
		ALTER TABLE customers ADD testCol VARCHAR(255);
		/* Modify column */
		ALTER TABLE customers MODIFY testCol int（11）;
		/* Drop column */
		ALTER TABLE customers DROP COLUMN testCol int（11）;
	-Select
		SELECT * FROM customers
		SELECT DISTINCT firstName, lastName from customers
		SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Country) FROM Customers;
		SELECT Count(*) AS DistinctCountries FROM (SELECT DISTINCT Country FROM Customers);
	-AND / OR / NOT  operators
		-and
		SELECT column1, column2, ...
		FROM table_name
		WHERE condition1 AND condition2 AND condition3 ...;
		-or
		SELECT column1, column2, ...
		FROM table_name
		WHERE condition1 OR condition2 OR condition3 ...;
		-not
		SELECT column1, column2, ...
		FROM table_name
		WHERE NOT condition;
	-ORDER BY
		SELECT * FROM Customers
		ORDER BY Country;
		SELECT * FROM Customers
		ORDER BY Country DESC;
		/* Order by Country first, then CustomerName if they have the same Country */
		SELECT * FROM Customers
		ORDER BY Country, CustomerName;
	-NULL values
		SELECT column_names
		FROM table_name
		WHERE column_name IS NULL;
		SELECT column_names
		FROM table_name
		WHERE column_name IS NOT NULL;
	-SELECT TOP
		SELECT TOP number|percent column_name(s)
		FROM table_name
		WHERE condition;
		-SQL
		SELECT TOP 3 * FROM Customers
		WHERE Country='Germany';
		SELECT TOP 50 PERCENT * FROM Customers;
		-MySQL
		SELECT * FROM Customers
		LIMIT 3;
	-MIN & MAX
		SELECT MIN(Price) AS SmallestPrice
		FROM Products;
		SELECT MAX(Price) AS LargestPrice
		FROM Products;
	-COUNT(), AVG(), SUM()
		SELECT COUNT(column_name)
		FROM table_name
		WHERE condition;
		SELECT AVG(column_name)
		FROM table_name
		WHERE condition;
		SELECT SUM(column_name)
		FROM table_name
		WHERE condition;
	-LIKE
		SELECT column1, column2, ...
		FROM table_name
		WHERE columnN LIKE pattern;
			WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a%'	Finds any values that start with "a"
			WHERE CustomerName LIKE '%a'	Finds any values that end with "a"
			WHERE CustomerName LIKE '%or%'	Finds any values that have "or" in any position
			WHERE CustomerName LIKE '_r%'	Finds any values that have "r" in the second position
			WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a_%'	Finds any values that start with "a" and are at least 2 characters in length
			WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a__%'	Finds any values that start with "a" and are at least 3 characters in length
			WHERE ContactName LIKE 'a%o'	Finds any values that start with "a" and ends with "o"
	-WILDCARDS
		%	Represents zero or more characters	bl% finds bl, black, blue, and blob
		_	Represents a single character	h_t finds hot, hat, and hit
		[]	Represents any single character within the brackets	h[oa]t finds hot and hat, but not hit
		^	Represents any character not in the brackets	h[^oa]t finds hit, but not hot and hat
		-	Represents a range of characters	c[a-b]t finds cat and cbt

	-IN
		SELECT column_name(s)
		FROM table_name
		WHERE column_name IN (SELECT STATEMENT);
		SELECT * FROM Customers
		WHERE Country NOT IN ('Germany', 'France', 'UK');
		SELECT * FROM Customers
		WHERE Country IN (SELECT Country FROM Suppliers);
	-Between
		SELECT column_name(s)
		FROM table_name
		WHERE column_name BETWEEN value1 AND value2;
		SELECT * FROM Products
		WHERE Price BETWEEN 10 AND 20;
		SELECT * FROM Products
		WHERE Price NOT BETWEEN 10 AND 20;
	-Aliases
		SELECT o.OrderID, o.OrderDate, c.CustomerName
		FROM Customers AS c, Orders AS o
		WHERE c.CustomerName='Around the Horn' AND c.CustomerID=o.CustomerID;
	-Join
		SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderDate
		FROM Orders
		INNER JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID=Customers.CustomerID;
		SELECT column_name(s)
		FROM table1
		LEFT JOIN table2
		ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;
		SELECT column_name(s)
		FROM table1
		FULL OUTER JOIN table2
		ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name
		WHERE condition;
		/* Self Join */
		SELECT column_name(s)
		FROM table1 T1, table1 T2
		WHERE condition;
	-Union
		SELECT column_name(s) FROM table1
		UNION
		SELECT column_name(s) FROM table2;
